                Iâ€™m a graphic design student since 2019. I learned various things such as Logo Design, Mockups, UX Design, Photo Manipulation and many more. 
                Now in 2022 I want to upgrade my skills and started to learn Front End Development. My goals are to be able to adapt in technology and have bigger opportunities in the future.
